Base module that allows to define complex rules on products to fulfill the conditions
of a loyalty program, so for a given set of products we could define a minimum quantity
and another for others, being all those criterias mandatory for the program to be
applied.

Use Cases / Context
===================

The functionality of the "Repeat" option that was included in this module is now included
in the rules of an odoo promotion. In this functionality a criterion was established in
which any of the products defined in the list of the criterion itself had to be in the
sales order lines in the minimum quantity established for the promotion to be applied.
This functionality can now be applied in the following way:

- Defining or editing a promotion.
- Modifying the rules to indicate a minimum quantity and selecting the products,
  either by domain, specific products, product category or tag.

This way the promotion will be applicable when any of those products are in the order l
ines and the total of all or one of them meets the minimum quantity, as it was done when
the "Repeat" option was checked.

Configuration
=============

To configure multiple product criterias:

#. Go to *Sales > Product > Loyalty Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. Go to rules. On the *Loyalty Criteria* field choose *Multi Product*.
#. The standard domain will be hidden and a criteria list will be shown.
#. Add as many criterias as needed for the desired promotion behavior.

In the list of criterias we can configure:

- Products: The products that should be present to fulfill the condition.

Some examples:

===== ================
  Qty      Products
===== ================
    1   Prod A
===== ================

A unit of Product A must be in the sale order.

===== ================
  Qty      Products
===== ================
    2   Prod B, Prod C
===== ================

A unit of Product B and Product C must be in the sale order.

Also note that all the defined criterias must be fulfilled or the program won't be
applied.
