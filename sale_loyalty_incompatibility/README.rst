This module allows to set incompatibilities between promotions, so when a promotion A
is not compatible with promotion B, they can't be applied together in a sales order.

Configuration
=============

To configure promotion incompatibilities (either coupons or promotion programs):

#. Go to *Sales > Catalog > Coupon Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. In the *Incompatible Promotions* set the promotions that aren't compatible with the
   one you're configuring.
#. Once set, the those promotions will have your configured promotion as incompatible
   as well, so they can't be used altogether in the same sale order.

Usage
=====

Once you've configured your incompatibilities, go to a quotations that fulfills your
incompatible promotions and try to set them altogether.

- A coupon program with no code, won't be applied.
- A coupon or program code, will raise an error.
