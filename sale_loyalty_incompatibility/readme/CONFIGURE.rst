To configure promotion incompatibilities (either coupons or promotion programs):

#. Go to *Sales > Catalog > Coupon Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. In the *Incompatible Promotions* set the promotions that aren't compatible with the
   one you're configuring.
#. Once set, the those promotions will have your configured promotion as incompatible
   as well, so they can't be used altogether in the same sale order.
