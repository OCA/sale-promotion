On the Discount & Loyalty form, in the Rewards popup screen, a "Limit Discounted Attributes" selection list enables this feature.
Options are: empty (disabled), "On List Price and Attributes", or "On Attributes Only".
This makes available a "Discounted Attributes" field, to select zero or more Attributes that will have the discount applied.
