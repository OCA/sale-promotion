website_sale_gift_card_limited_to
=========

This module allows you to sell an item using a gift card only if that gift card is used to sell that item. 
When the gift card code is validated, the module will check whether the card is valid for the items in the basket. 

This module works with gift_card_limited_to, which allows you to add an item limit to a gift card.
