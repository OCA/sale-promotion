Configuration
=============

You can set this feature on or off in every company. To do so:

#. Go to *Sales > Configuration > Settings*
#. In the *Pricing* section you'll find the option *Auto refresh promotions*.

Usage
=====

You need to configure a *Promotion program* with the option *Promo Code Usage* set to
*Automatically applied*. This can be done in *Sales > Products > Promotion programs*.

Now, make a quotation that fulfill the promotion condition and the promotion will be
automatically applied.
