Configuration
=============

To configure multiple product rewards:

#. Go to *Sales > Catalog > Coupon Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. Choose the criteria of appliance you want to use and the minimum quantities, that
   will be used to calculate the times the rewards can be applied.
#. On the *Reward Type* field choose *Multi Gift*.
#. You'll see a now the *Gift list* on which you can add the products you want to give
   away and the quantities for each of them.

An example:

 ===== ================
  Qty      Products
 ===== ================
    3   Prod A
    2   Prod B
 ===== ================

With a minimum quantity of 3, for every 3 units of products that fulfill the domain
we'd get 3 units of A and 2 of B. So if the valid products quantities are 11, we'd
get 9 of product A and 6 of product B.

Usage
=====

Once configured, apply the programs as usual to get the expected rewards.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Gifts are applied just once independently from the min quantity set.
