This module allows to configure a limit on the times a promotion can be applied. Two
limits can be configured: customer and salesman. Those limits apply to either programs
or coupons.

Configuration
=============

To configure customer limits:

#. Go to *Sales > Catalog > Coupon Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. Set the *Maximum Customer Applications* to the number of times a coupon can be used
   by a customer.

NOTE: The customer limit is applied at commercial entity level, not for each contact
inside the entity.

To configure salesmen limits:

#. Go to *Sales > Catalog > Coupon Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. Add salesmen to the *Salesmen Limits* list and their maximum number of applications.
#. You can add different limits to different salesmen groups.
#. If you want to constrain the use of the promotion to the salesmen list, set the
   option *Strict limit* on, so any other salesman won't be able to apply the promotion.

Usage
=====

Once the program limits are configured, apply the programs as usual in your sale orders.

Once the limit for a customer or a salesman is reached, if we try to apply a promotion:

- A code promotion will raise an error.
- A program with no code won't be applied.
- A coupon belonging to a limited program will raise an error.
- A promotion applied on the next order won't generate the coupon.
