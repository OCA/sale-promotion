To configure customer limits:

#. Go to *Sales > Catalog > Coupon Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. Set the *Maximum Customer Applications* to the number of times a coupon can be used
   by a customer.

NOTE: The customer limit is applied at commercial entity level, not for each contact
inside the entity.

To configure salesmen limits:

#. Go to *Sales > Catalog > Coupon Programs* and select or create a new one.
#. Add salesmen to the *Salesmen Limits* list and their maximum number of applications.
#. You can add different limits to different salesmen groups.
#. If you want to constrain the use of the promotion to the salesmen list, set the
   option *Strict limit* on, so any other salesman won't be able to apply the promotion.
