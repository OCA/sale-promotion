This module allows to define multiple reward products on promotions.

Use Cases / Context
===================

For the 'buy_x_get_y' type promotion, the 'Reward_type' field is restricted to the 'Product'
option only and the possibility to select 'Multigift' is disabled. This restriction is implemented
because, in this scenario, the 'reward_type' field becomes 'readonly'.

It is crucial to note that modifying the values displayed in this field to set different
values according to the type of promotion may generate conflicts with other modules that
contribute to the configuration of this same field. Therefore, it is recommended not to
alter these values directly, as this may affect the consistency and functionality of other
components of the system.

To configure similar promotions, it is suggested to modify another type of promotion by
adapting its rules and rewards according to specific needs. This provides a more secure
and consistent way to manage custom configurations without compromising the integrity of
the system.

Configuration
=============

To configure multiple product rewards:

#. Go to *Sales > Products > Discount & Loyalty* and select or create a new one.
#. Choose the criteria of appliance you want to use and the minimum quantities, that
   will be used to calculate the times the rewards can be applied.
#. On the *Program Type* field choose *Multi Gift*.
#. You'll see a now the *Gift list* on which you can add the products you want to give
   away and the quantities for each of them.

An example:

 ===== ================
  Qty      Products
 ===== ================
    3   Prod A
    2   Prod B
 ===== ================

With a minimum quantity of 3, for every 3 units of products that fulfill the domain
we'd get 3 units of A and 2 of B. So if the valid products quantities are 11, we'd
get 3 of product A and 2 of product B.

Usage
=====

This module is a base to be used by extra modules that use it in sale orders, PoS
orders, etc.
