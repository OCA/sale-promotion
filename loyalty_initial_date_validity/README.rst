This module extends the functionality of Loyalty to add the date_from field to
promotions. The aim of this is to be able to set a start date for a promotion.
It's a technical base to be extended with top level functionality (sales, pos).

Use Cases / Context
===================

This module is created in v16 because in v15 there was a field rule_date_from to set the
start date of a promotion in the coupon_program module and in v16 this field disappears
and there is no other field to replace it. This is why it was decided to add the
date_from field at promotion level as well as the date_to field and recover this
functionality.

Usage
=====

To use this module simply go to edit or create a promotion and set a start date in
the field labelled "Start date".

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This module will not be needed in v17 as this functionality is reinstated.
