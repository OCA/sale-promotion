This module extends the loyalty_partner_applicability functionality. When this filter
is defined, the promotion rule will only be applied to customers who meet the specified
conditions in the filter.
The coupons generated in a sales order for a specific member promotion can be shared
between members of the same trading entity.

Configuration
=============

To configure the partner based promotion filter:

Go to *Sales > Products > Discount & Loyalty* and select or create a new one.
In conditional rules set the condition based on customers.

In promotions that generate coupons for the next sale, we can allow coupon sharing
between members of the same commercial entity.
To allow this, go to *Settings > Sales > Pricing* and check the option "Allow coupon sharing".

Usage
=====

Go to a sales order and apply the promotion accordingly. If the sales order meets the
requirements set in the partner based filter the promotion will be applied to that order.
