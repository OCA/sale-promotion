This module extends the functionality of `sale_loyalty_order_suggestion` by giving hints
of available promotions whose reward is multi-gift and whose rules require a minimum quantity of products.

Usage
=====

To use this module:

* Configure or create a promotion and set in its rules a minimum quantity of products required.
* Create a sales order and add one of the products that were part of the rewards to the order lines. This line will be marked with an icon (üéÅ) that will appear at the bottom right.
* Click on the icon and the wizard will open with the available promotions.
* Select the promotion and the products needed to apply it.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

For the moment only suggestions for promotions whose multi-gift rewards include products
added to the sales order and whose rules have product-based criteria will be taken into
account. This module could be extended to take into account other types of rules in the
loyalty programs to be able to apply the promotion from the wizard.
